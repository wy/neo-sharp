# Overview

Neo-sharp is a new core and node implementation of NEO with three main project goals:

- To break interdependencies in NEO and allow a plug-able modular design to be used by node implementations. The modules will consist in: Network, VM, Persistence and Consensus.

- To create testing infrastructure for both specification of behavior and benchmark of modifications.

- To develop an initial fully compatible version and one new experimental high performance module for each component.

This project is not about adding new features to NEO, it is about establishing and adhering coding best practcies, implementing proper design patterns, and ensuring the code is testable with a focus on unit test code coverage.
